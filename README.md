# WELCOME TO MY DIGITAL BRAIN!

More comfortably known as `DIGI-BRAIN`!

`DIGI-BRAIN` is my first attempt to create a digital knowledge-base that mainly revolves around Computer Science.

My notes are a collection of the teeniest details I come across which I believe will be useful for those aha! moments in the future.

## My Inspiration âœ¨

Jots and Tittles that I scratched somewhere on a scratchpad and then forgetting just to remembering months later having written them somewhere but unable to retrieve the page! Need I say more ðŸ˜…

These notes are basically me trying to communicate with myself :grinning:

Just like how our brain associates and links ideas together to make things work, I too have utilized the associative note-taking structure in this journal!

That being said, click on the topics or sub-topics on the left sidebar to browse through my notes! :bowtie:
