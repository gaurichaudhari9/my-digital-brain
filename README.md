# My first page

This is my first attempt to create a digital knowledge-base that mainly revolves around Computer Science.

My notes are a collection of the teeniest details I come across which I believe will be useful for those aha! moments in the future.

These notes are basically me trying to communicate with myself :grinning:

Just like how our brain associates and links ideas together to make things work, I too have utilized the associative note-taking structure in this blog!

That being said,

**WELCOME TO MY BRAIN !** :bowtie:
