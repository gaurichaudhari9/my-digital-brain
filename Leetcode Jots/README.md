# Leetcode Jots

I like speaking to myself while solving Leetcode problems, or perhaps try to teach a non-existent nobody (ðŸ‘») in a narrative way. I tend to retain the concepts better.

This area will cover how I would approach problems of Leetcode, what their types are and what concepts they use.
